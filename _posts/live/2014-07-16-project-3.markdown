<h3>What it is</h3>
<p>A visualization tool for chemical networks.<br>In plain English, that means the tool takes a list of reactions happening between molecules and generates interactive graphics to visually explore what's happening between those molecules.</p>
<h4>Highlights</h4>
<p>This is basically a data-visualization tool designed for a specific purpose. To bring that data to life, I used the powerful D3 library.</p>
