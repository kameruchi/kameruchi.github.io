<h3>What it is</h3>
<p>An online store to receive and manage subscriptions to a monthly surprise box sent by post and customized to the customer. Aimed exclusively to the Japanese market, the website is all in Japanese and has a <em>kawaii</em> and playful look. Special attention was paid to the UX to create a smooth check-out experience.</p>
<h4>Highlights</h4>
<p>This is a system designed to do much more than just registering subscriptions and process payments: It automates the entire process. It creates labels for the post, sends notifications, manages reviews, counts stock and selects items for each box based on previous reviews.</p>
